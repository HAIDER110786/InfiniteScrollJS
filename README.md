# INFINITE SCROLL USING JAVASCRIPT AND AXIOS 


This file uses axios to get dummy posts from json placeholder website.
 
At a time, this file only fetches 7 posts, and when the page is scrolled to near the bottom another request is sent to the next 7 posts. This keeps on happening until 
all the posts are fetched from the website.

Also when you scroll to the bottom of the page, a loader will be shown while the next 7 posts are loaded, once all posts are loaded a message of 'no more posts' would be seen.
