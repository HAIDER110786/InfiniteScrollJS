# INFINITE SCROLL USING JAVASCRIPT AND AXIOS 


This file uses axios to get dummy posts from json placeholder website.
 
 At a time, this file only fetches 7 posts, and when the page is scrolled to near the bottom another request is sent to the next 5 posts. This keeps on happening until 
 all the posts are fetched from the website
